# Text-Summarizer

This project implements a few problem solving concepts using C++ to create summary from an input text which can be extracted from a .txt file or entered manually. 

Summarizer can be approached in two ways:
<ol>
    <li><b>Extractive Summarization<b>: Select key sentences from text (what this project will do since we're using C++)</li>
    <li><b>Abstractive summarization</b>: Stuff that GPT can do better</li>
</ol>

# Implementation Roadmap

<ol>
    <li>Input text & parsing</li>
    <li>Tokenize & clean the text</li>
    <li>Calculate sentence score</li>
    <li>Select top sentences</li>
    <li>Output summary</li>
</ol>

# Algorithms

<ol>
    <li><b>Tokenization</b>: Splitting text into words/sentences</li>
    <li><b>Frequency-based scoring</b>: Using word counts to rank sentences</li>
    <li><b>Sorting Algorithm</b>: To prioritize top-scoring sentences</li>
</ol>
